  1. Athletes Mental Health Foundation: They are a non-profit organization that, as a community of athletes, coaches,
  parents, advocates, and mental health experts, are dedicated to solving the mental health crisis in sports. They have
  "systemically minded" licensed mental health professionals trained to consider the whole system in the change process.
  From free trainings, to discussions and ongoing research projects: They make it easy for athletes to feel supported
  and heard, aim to find solutions to the mental health crisis in sports and are here to have those uncomfortable but
  important conversations.

  <br>
  2. Athletes For Hope: Founded in 2006 by a group of elite athletes, including Muhammad Ali and Mia Hamm, they are also
  a non-profit organization dedicated to encouraging athletes to learn about philanthropy and involve themselves with
  charitable causes to further encourage community involvement. Due to the concern from the athletes they've helped,
  they created two essential mental health programs to increase athletic advocacy: AFH Wellbeing and AFH CHAMPS. They
  have continued to work with more athletes and other organizations/foundations for continuous mental health involvement
  in athletic communities to this day and have been responsible for 
  200,000+ positively-impacted children on a monthly basis.
