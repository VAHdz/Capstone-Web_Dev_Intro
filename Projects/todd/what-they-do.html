    The Athletes Mental Health Foundation's Mission
  </h1>
  <p> At the Athletes Mental Health Foundation - Athletes will be properly supported. From resources such as mental
    health professional therapists and free trainings, to discussions and ongoing research projects, they make it easy
    for athletes to feel supported and heard. To me, this is extremely essential, as athletes' mental health is often
    overlooked. As an athlete who struggles with mental health myself, I understand how detrimental being overlooked and
    unsupported can feel for athletes struggling like me; and the Athletes Mental Health Foundation is all about
    bridging that gap.
