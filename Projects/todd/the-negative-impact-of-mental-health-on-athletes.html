        The Negative Impact of Mental Health on Athletes
      </h1>

<p> Athletes are at a higher risk of developing mental health issues due to the intense pressure and expectations placed on them. Sports anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues can be caused by the fear of failure, perfection, and the constant comparison to others. Additionally, the consistent physical demands and stress from training and competition can take a toll on an athlete's body and mind. There are multiple athletes that have been ruined by their mental health issues. A few examples are: <br>
  <br>
1. Aaron Hernandez - Former NFL Tight End for the New England Patriots. Diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD, OCD, and ADHD.
<br>
 <br>
  2. Antonio Brown - Former NFL Wide Receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and ADHD.
  <br>
  <br>
  3. Junior Seau - Former NFL Linebacker for the San Diego Chargers. Diagnosed with depression, PTSD, and CTE. Sadly in 2012, he took his own life due to these mental health battles after retiring from football.
   <br>
    <br>
  4.Micheal Phelps - 23-time Olympic Gold Medalist. Diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. He has openly spoken about his struggles with mental health in his olympic career multiple times.
  <br>
    <br>
 5. DeMar DeRozan - NBA Player for the Chicago Bulls. Diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. He has openly spoken about his struggles with mental health in his NBA career multiple times, and has even written a book about it.
  <br>
  <br> These are just a few examples of athletes whose careers have either been ruined by or detrimentally affected by their mental heatlh issues, some being due to the pressure of sports overall and others being the result of the physicality of the sport itself. As previously mentioned, this is a large unaddressed issue in sports as a whole that I am very familiar with and passionate about spreading awareness for.
