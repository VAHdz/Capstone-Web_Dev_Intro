<h1>Queer Youth</h1>
  <p> The queer youth are more prone to to suicide and depression more than other groups due to the rejection of society. The unique challenge of being part of the queer youth is that stigmas can look different for each person. Due to this it can be hard to find programs that are catered to the needs of the queer youth. Often times, programs that are catered to the needs of the queer youth aren't as effective as they could be. This is why programs like the Marsha P Johnson Institute are fairly important. </p>

  <h2>Examples:</h2>
  <body>
    <p>The Marsha P Johnson Institute should be important to everyone because it is a program that helps people who are LGBTQ+ and are in need of help. It is a safe space for people to come and talk about their problems and get help. It is a program that is run by volunteers and its a program that is run by the community for the community. This program is to help prevent suicide amongst young people who are LGBTQ+. All in all, this program is to protect and defend human rights of transgender people specifically. However, it will also always be a program that is open to anyone who needs help.   </p>

      The Trevor Project originated from a movie of a 13 year old boy who struggled with suicidal thoughts as part of the LGBTQ+ community. The Trevor Project is the leading non-profit organization dedicated to suicide prevention and crisis intervention which provides 24/7 resources. The Trevor project is for all identities of the Lgbtq+ youth.

      Understanding Queer Youth is the key to understanding reducing mental health issues in the community. Eventually the community will be able to flourish in all settings of life starting with the youth to stabilize them. Seting up these resources early on will help the Lgbtq youth to grow.
