  <h1> Is Climate Change the Greatest Threat of Our Lifetime? Or Global Warming?
  </h2> Global warming refers specifically to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to rising greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change encompasses global warming but also includes a broader range of changes, such as rising sea levels, shrinking glaciers, and shifts in weather patterns. While global warming focuses on temperature rise, climate change includes the side effects of warming, like more frequent droughts and extreme weather events. These distinctions highlight that global warming is a component of the larger phenomenon of climate change. I know many people that think climate change and global warming are the same but it's a completeley different issue and it's essential to know the difference. Global Warming is the increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans. This is caused by the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which traps heat. You may be wondering why this is extermely important or relevant, Well, climate change affects every aspect of life and it impacts biodiversity and many vulnerable populations. Global Warming is an aspect of climate change, meaning the more it occurs, the more our enviornment will be affected. So the overarching question is, What can we do to stop this from happening?
<h3> What's the difference between climate change and global warming?

</h2>Global Warming is said to be the longterm increase in the Earth's average surface temperature, caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases such as, Carbon dioxide, Methane, and Nitrious oxide. Because Global Warming changes temperatures, this effects habitats and food availability--forcing animals to adapt and avoid extinction. Global Warming is a major issue because it affects the enviornment, human health, economies and future generations. It's not just about the planet getting warmer, it's about the changes in our natural sytems that will ungergo unpredictable and dangerous changes.

  <ul><li>The atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increased from around 278 parts per million (ppm) in 1750 to 423.9 ppm in 2024, an increase of 53%. The average CO2 growth rate during the past decade was 2.57 ppm per year. The increase in concentration from 2023 to 2024 was 3.5 ppm, a record increase in the recent observational history. Emissions from fossil fuels have been the largest source of human emissions since the 1950s. (WMO)  </li>

  Climate change is the broader term that includes this warming as well as its side effects, like shrinking glaciers, shifting plant blooming times, and rising sea levels. It increases the frequency and intensity of destructive events like hurricanes, heatwaves, wildfires, and floods. There's shifts in rainfall patterns and rising temperatures lead to severe droughts and water scarcity, which cause crop failures and threaten the global food supply. It is identified as a top threat to global health, contributing to increased deaths from heat stress, malnutrition, and the spread of infectious diseases. If left unaddressed, climate change could push 100 million more people into poverty by 2030 and displace millions more due to rising sea levels.

<h4> SOLUTIONS </h4>

  

    <h5> <u> RAINFOREST TRUST </u> </h5>
    This organizations goal is to preserve habitats around the globe. They are working to protect aniamls from extinction and they're doing this by creating rainforest reserves through partnerships, community engagement and donor support. They are committed to raising and allocating $200 million, and pledges to contribute to saving half of the world’s threatened birds and mammals and permanently locking up the carbon equivalent of three years’ emissions from the entire United States economy.
    <ul>
      <li> By 2025, Rainforest Trust will have protected or be in the process of protecting 125 million acres including seven percent of all currently unprotected high-integrity tropical and subtropical forests, permanently locking up 15 billion tons of carbon.
Rainforest Trust will have provided a lasting home for half of all known threatened bird and mammal species on Earth – and a fifth of all known threatened terrestrial and freshwater species. </li>
